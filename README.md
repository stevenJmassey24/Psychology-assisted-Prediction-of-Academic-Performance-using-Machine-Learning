# Psychology-assisted-Prediction-of-Academic-Performance-using-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Project
The psychological state of the student has deep influence on their academic performance is being proved by various studies. The paper demonstrates the impact of student’s psychology and their learning and study skills in the predicting their academic performance. The experiment was performed on the real time data collected from final year students. The matriculate and preuniversity examination scores, five semester scores along with data on the motivation level, information processing ability and other learning and study skills were taken as input to the model to predict the Cumulative Grade Point Average(CGPA) of the sixth semester. Two machine learning algorithms were used to test the impact of students’ psychology on prediction which includes Neural Network for numeric prediction of sixth semester CGPA and Decision Tree for classification of failures in sixth semester. The performance of the models were evaluated using the coefficient of correlation R and the Mean  Squared Error. The accuracy of the prediction increases about 4 to 6%. The study reveals that level of motivation in student’s life and the way they perceive the information and use the available study materials for the examination, all counts in prediction of their examination performance.
